# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a Machine Learning project built by me and my friends.

## Team Work

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed unnecessary columns
  - Handled missing (`null`) values by filling them appropriately
- **Modeling**:
  - Applied `LogisticRegression` for binary classification (survived or not)

## 📊 Model Performance

- Achieved an **accuracy of 84%** 

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

We used the classic [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle, which contains information about passengers like age, gender, class, and survival status.
